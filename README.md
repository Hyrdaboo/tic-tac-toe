If you are here by chance thank you for coming along you cool! But my coding skills aren't so read the short instructions below to make it work

1. after cloning repo open it in unity 
2. find prefabs folder that is located in the assets folder
3. drag canvas prefab to the scene and that's all! I don't know how to do that automatically for you. Anyway thanks for sticking around!
